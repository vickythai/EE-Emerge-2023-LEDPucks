# Mechanical Design
The mechanical model for the pucks were sketched and designed in Fusion 360. It features two components: the body and the bottom lid. The puck body serves to house the pcb, neopixels, and a friction-fitted piece of acrylic. The bottom lid holds the battery bracket and allows for quick access to the internals.
