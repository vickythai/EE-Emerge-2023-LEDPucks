# LED Pucks

LED Pucks is an interactive project created by a team of UCDavis [EE-Emerge](https://ece.ucdavis.edu/ee-emerge) students. Inspired by the popular arcade game, Whack-a-mole, the project consists of multiple devices that communicate over a wireless mesh network. Together, these devices are a part of a fun and interactive game that utilizes capacitive touch sensors and colorful LED lights. The goal of the game is to tap the various pucks when their LEDs turn on in order to turn them off and accumulate the most points within a time limit.
