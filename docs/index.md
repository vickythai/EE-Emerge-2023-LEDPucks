# LED Pucks

LED Pucks is an interactive project created by a team of UCDavis [EE-Emerge](https://ece.ucdavis.edu/ee-emerge) students. Inspired by the popular arcade game, Whack-a-mole, the project featues multiple devices that communicate over a wireless mesh network. Together, these devices form a fun and interactive game that utilizes capacitive touch sensors and colorful LED lights. The goal of the game is to tap the various pucks when their LEDs turn on in order to turn them off and accumulate the most points within a time limit. 

# About the Project:

With the wireless feature of the pucks, they can be placed anywhere within a 50ft radius, encouraging people to get up and run around to hit the various pucks. We used [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) microcontrollers, which have Wi-Fi capabilities that allow us to control the pucks wirelessly. We collected user input through [capacitive sensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitive_sensing) by placing a piece of acrylic on copper tape, which is wired to the ESP32.
